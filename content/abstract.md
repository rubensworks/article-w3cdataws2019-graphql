## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
GraphQL offers a highly popular query languages for graphs,
which is well known among Web developers.
Each GraphQL graph is scoped within an interface-specific schema,
which makes it difficuly to integrate data from multiple interfaces.
The RDF graph model, on the other hand, offers a solution to this integration problem.
<!-- Need         -->
Different techniques are possible
to enable querying over RDF graphs using GraphQL queries.
<!-- Task         -->
<!-- Object       -->
In this position statement,
we provide a high-level overview of the existing techniques,
and how they differ.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
We argue that each of these techniques have their merits,
but standardization is essential to simplify the link between GraphQL and RDF.
