## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This is a position statement for participation to the
[W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data 2019](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/){:.mandatory}.
This position statement lies within the topic of graph query languages,
and focuses on the [GraphQL](cite:cites graphql) query language, and its link to the [RDF](cite:cites spec:rdf) data model.
The reason for focussing on GraphQL is because it is highly popular among Web developers,
which will significantly lower the barrier towards adopting a technique to use it for querying RDF.

In the next section, we will list existing techniques for using GraphQL to query RDF data.
After that, we conclude with a proposal on a way forward to harmonize these approaches,
which we hope to discuss during the workshop.
