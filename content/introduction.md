## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This is a position statement for participation to the
[W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data 2019](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/){:.mandatory}.
This position statement lies within the topic of graph query languages,
and focuses on the [GraphQL](cite:cites graphql) query language, and its link to the [RDF](cite:cites spec:rdf) data model.

We focus on GraphQL, because it provides an easy-to-use and highly popular language for querying graphs.
Unfortunately, these queries only have semantics in isolated servers.
In order to add meaning _across_ data sources, GraphQL queries can be aligned with the RDF data model.

In the next section, we will list existing techniques for using GraphQL to query RDF data.
After that, we conclude with a proposal on a way forward to harmonize these approaches,
which we hope to discuss during the workshop.
